<BrandHighlight /> is a component library at heart. This means that there's very little boilerplate that you have to do to get started. You just choose which components you'd like to use, and you have immediate access to them.

Components use attributes to give you customization options. Attributes can be anything from `textColor` to `tooltip`.

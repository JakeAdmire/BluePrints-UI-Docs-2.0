## What is blueprints-ui?
<Subheading text="A cleaner, better design system for ReactJS" />
<br />
<br />
A small UI component library <b>and</b> a way to keep me active and up-to-date on the best practices for front-end software development & design.

### Who made it?
<Subheading text="Jake Admire, a front-end software developer from Colorado." />
<br />
<br />
I'm very passionate about two things: development & design. So I was obviously excited about the thought of building a component UI library.
